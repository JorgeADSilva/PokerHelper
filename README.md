# PokerHelper :black_joker:
This project arose from the idea of creating a helper for those who want to start in this very famous game called Poker.
This will be developed over time with the aim of becoming more complete and intuitive to use as I also evolve in the knowledge of the game itself.

This Project will use the Flutter version 2.1.0 and first will be mainly focused for the Web.
